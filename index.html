<h1 style="color:black">3 Reasons, why should you become software engineer</h1>
	<div class="first" style="padding-bottom:3%"><h2>1. The job outlook for a software engineering career is amazing.</h2>
		<img src="https://marketresearchforecastsblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/giphy-1.gif?w=712" class="gif">
<div style="display:inline-block; width:40%; margin-top: 0%; margin-left: 5%;text-align: justify;"><p>Obviously, it is not wrong to say that The job outlook for a software engineering career is amazing.The last thing you want as a college grad is to earn your degree only to be unable to find a job in your field. Not only is this type of situation extremely frustrating, but it can also be tremendously demotivating, too.
<br>
Yet, this issue doesn‚Äôt appear to be much of a concern if your goal is to work in the software development space as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that this category of jobs is anticipated to grow by 24 percent.
<br>
By comparison, the average growth rate for all other occupations combined is only seven percent. This equates to an additional 302,500 software development jobs by the year 2026.<br></p>

	<div class="first" style="padding-bottom:3%"><h2>2. The field is incredibly broad.</h2>
		<img src="https://s3.envato.com/files/7ffbaf0f-da09-42a5-82ce-3854ff6bb540/inline_image_preview.jpg" class="gif" style="width:45%;display: inline;margin-left: 5%">
<div style="display:inline-block; width:40%; margin-top: 0%; margin-left:2%;text-align: justify "><p>Another reason a software engineering career is a great choice is because the field is so broad and encompasses a variety of roles related to both computer applications and systems. This enables you to work in the area or areas that interest you most.<br><br>

For instance, some software engineers spend their days building or rebuilding computer information systems. Others use their talents to create webpages or enhance a company‚Äôs network security. It‚Äôs up to you which direction you want to take.<br>

You can also work in most any industry because they all use software to some extent. Want to put your skills to use by working in a healthcare facility? No problem. Or maybe your dream is to work for a nonprofit? Yes, you can do that, too.<br></p></div></div>
<br>
<div class="first" style="padding-bottom:3%"><h2>3. You Enjoy Teamwork.</h2>

<img src="https://i.gifer.com/4q43.gif" class="gif" style="width:25%;display: inline;margin-bottom: 0%">
<div style="display:inline-block; width:40%; margin-top: 0%; margin-left: 8%;text-align: justify;display: "><p>Some career choices are fairly solitary because they require you to work all on your own. However, the job search site Monster reports that a ‚Äúsoftware engineer‚Äù career isn‚Äôt one of them as individuals in these roles typically work in teams.<br> That makes this career path more appealing if you fall into the second category.<br>

Of course, being an effective team player also requires that you have some of the soft skills necessary to work effectively in teams.<br><br> Monster shares that among them are being empathetic, having good listening skills, and being able to accept criticism.<br>

You don‚Äôt necessarily have to start out with all of these skills, either. You can always learn them as you go.<br></p></div></div>
